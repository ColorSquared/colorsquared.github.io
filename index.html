                <p>This app does not collect personal information from users.</p>

                <h6>Ads and Advertising</h6>
                <p>This app uses third-party advertising services. These services, including Google, may collect information including
                your device-specific advertising ID to generate interests and demographics. These interests and demographics may be
                used to serve better targeted ads for the user. Additionally, third-party vendors may use cookies to serve ads
                based on a user's prior internet activity. This use of cookies allows third-party advertisers including Google
                and its partners to serve directed ads of interest to app users. </p>
                <p>Users may opt out of personalized advertising through the third-party ad provider <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated">here.</a></p>

                <h6>Third Party Links</h6>
                <p>While the app ColorSquared does not link to services external to the app, our third-party advertisers may
                present ads which direct the user to third-party sites and services. It is made clear in the functionality of the
                app when this occurs.</p>

                <h6>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance'</h6>
                <p>We do not collect or maintain information in our app from those we know are under the age of 13.
